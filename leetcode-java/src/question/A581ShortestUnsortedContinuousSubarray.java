/**
 * <p>
 * Given an integer array, you need to find one continuous subarray that if you
 * only sort this subarray in ascending order, then the whole array will be
 * sorted in ascending order, too. You need to find the shortest such subarray
 * and output its length.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Input: [2, 6, 4, 8, 10, 9, 15]<br>
 * Output: 5<br>
 * Explanation: You need to sort [6, 4, 8, 10, 9] in ascending order to make the
 * whole array sorted in ascending order.
